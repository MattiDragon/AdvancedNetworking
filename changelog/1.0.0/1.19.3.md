Advanced Networking is now on version 1.0.0. This means that I have added all the functionality that I originally planned for the mod.
I will probably still continue adding features and updates, but the rate might decrease.

* Add new nodes
  * Add filter nodes. They allow restricting the types of items and fluids transferred.
  * Add storage inspection nodes, allowing you to read the capacity and fill level of storages.
* Cable and interface improvements
  * Add ability to name interfaces and implement new selection screen for them.
  * Add gui to cable, replacing the old click-for-id system. Here you can set the names and quickly change modes.
  * Improve the placement of items in the creative screen.
* Update YACL
  * Sliders in config have been replace by number fields for more control.
* Update nodeflow
  * Added copy, paste and cut actions for context menu
  * Fix scrolling being broken in node selector
  * Fix node render order and make clicked node jump to top
* Internal changes and fixes
  * Rework the stream system internally to remove one step and make future changes easier.
  * Fix a lot of translation related issues.
  * Update to new graphlib version and remove unnecessary debug renderer.
  * Set up gametest for automatic testing. Currently unused as I still have to figure out how to link interfaces properly.

As this release includes a lot of internal changes, please report any and all issues on github.
